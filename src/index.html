          I was born in Romania and moved to London as a child and lived my
          childhood here I was always a fan of video games, so that incentivised
          me to use the computer a lot; and in Year 9, I was intrigued by the
          idea of coding and wanted to try it myself. So I took Computer Science
          for GCSE and stuck to it, because I enjoyed it and it was fun.
