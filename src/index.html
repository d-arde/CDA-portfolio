        <p>
          I was born in Romania and moved to London as a child and lived my
          childhood here I was always a fan of video games, so that incentivised
          me to use the computer a lot; and in Year 9, I was intrigued by the
          idea of coding and wanted to try it myself. So I took Computer Science
          for GCSE and stuck to it, because I enjoyed it and it was fun.

      <h1>Discord.js Solana TPS Tracker</h1>
      <p>As a hobby I do NFTs, to help the community, which is active mostly
        on Discord. I decided to make a discord bot that calculates the average
        transactions per second (TPS) of the most recent block on the Solana Blockchain, the chain I trade NFTs on.
        This bot is publicly available by a given discord link. It is currently being used by servers with 1k+ people.
